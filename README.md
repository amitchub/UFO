# UFO Sightings Module 11 Challenge

## Overview of the project analysis
The UFO sightings webpage is designed to show data of UFO sightings.  This is done via a filtered table.  The filtering can be performed on the following criteria:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

## Project Analysis Results:


To the left of the table is a filter search box. There you can enter a date, city, state, country, or shape and the table will update when a character is present and enter is pressed. Below are two examples of how searched for El Cajon, CA and KY are displayed.

## Summary:

A drawback to the webpage is the filter can only look at one id at a time. For example you cannot look at the state of California and Kentucky at the same time.

Drop down menu where you can pick multiple criteria would eliminate this drawback.
Also the ability to sort the table by more recent or least recent would improve user experience.
